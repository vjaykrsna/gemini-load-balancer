# Gemini Load Balancer

A modern NextJS application that serves as a proxy server for the Google Gemini API, with key management, load balancing, and a beautiful UI. This application allows you to efficiently manage multiple Gemini API keys, automatically rotate between them and to monitor your API usage with detailed statistics.

- **Customizable Settings**: Configure key rotation, rate limits, and more

## Architecture

The Gemini Load Balancer is built using Next.js App Router, which allows for a unified application that handles both the frontend UI and backend API routes. The application follows a modern architecture:

- **Frontend**: React with Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and accessible interface
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes that proxy requests to the Gemini API
- **State Management**: React Context API and SWR for efficient data fetching
- **Data Storage**: SQLite database (`data/database.db`) for API keys and settings. File-based storage for logs.
- **Styling**: Chakra UI with Tailwind CSS for a consistent design system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun runtime (Recommended)
- Git (for version control)
- A Gemini API key (for testing)

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and Bun installed. Then, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shariqriazz/gemini-load-balancer.git
cd gemini-load-balancer

# Install dependencies (choose one)
bun install
# OR
npm install --legacy-peer-deps # Use if you encounter peer dependency issues
```

## Configuration

The application requires minimal configuration:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (or copy from `.env.example`)
2. Set the necessary environment variables. The `.env.example` file provides comments explaining each variable. Here's an example structure:

```env
# Server Configuration
# The port number the application will run on
PORT=4265

# Admin Login
# Password to access the admin dashboard
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secret_admin_password_here # Example: iwfgQ4Qx3YgCzL4KDO0ZXKB5AQwRXk51
# This password is also used to encrypt sensitive data like session information.

# Optional Admin Login Enforcement
# Set to 'false' to disable the admin login requirement for the entire application.
# Set to 'true' or leave blank to enforce admin login.
REQUIRE_ADMIN_LOGIN=true

# Master API Key for Incoming Requests (Optional)
# If set, this single key MUST be provided as a Bearer token in the Authorization header
# for incoming requests to the /api/v1/chat/completions endpoint.
# This adds an authentication layer to YOUR API endpoint.
# Leave blank to skip this specific incoming authentication check.
MASTER_API_KEY=
```

Note: Google Gemini API keys and rotation settings are managed through the UI (stored in the `data/database.db` SQLite database), not directly in the `.env` file.

## Recommended Settings

For optimal performance and reliability, we recommend the following configuration:

### API Key Management

- Add at least 5 API keys for proper load balancing
- Keep at least 3 backup keys for failover
- Remove keys that consistently fail or get rate limited

### Performance Settings

- Set key rotation request count to 3-5 requests per key
- Set rate limit cooldown to 60 seconds
- Configure max failure count to 3 before key deactivation
- Enable automatic key rotation

### Monitoring

- Check the dashboard daily for key health
- Review error logs every few days
- Monitor key usage distribution for balance
- Keep track of error rates for each key

### Best Practices

- Regularly rotate your API keys (every 30-90 days)
- Keep your total request count below 80% of your quota
- Use the playground to test new prompts before production
- Save frequently used prompts for consistency
- Tag or label your keys based on their usage (e.g., "production", "testing")

### Resource Management

- Set log retention to 14-30 days to manage storage
- Archive important logs before deletion
- Regularly backup your `data/database.db` file.
- Clean up unused saved prompts periodically

## Running the Application

Development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
# Using Bun
bun dev
# OR (using explicit run command)
# bun run dev
```

Production deployment:

```bash
# Build the application
bun build
# OR (using explicit run command)
# bun run build

# Start the production server
bun start
# OR (using explicit run command)
# bun run start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:4269 (or your configured PORT)

Using PM2 for process management:

```bash
# Ensure pm2 is installed globally (e.g., npm install -g pm2 or bun install -g pm2)

# Start the application using pm2 with bun
pm2 start bun --name gemini-load-balancer -- start

# OR Start the application using pm2 with npm
# pm2 start npm --name gemini-load-balancer -- run start

# Monitor the application
# pm2 list
# pm2 logs gemini-load-balancer
```

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**:

   - Keys are stored in the SQLite database (`data/database.db`). Ensure appropriate file system permissions for this file.
   - Keys are masked in the UI and logs
   - Access to the admin panel is protected by the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set in the `.env` file. This password also encrypts sensitive data.

2. **Rate Limiting**:

   - Built-in rate limit detection
   - Automatic key rotation on rate limits
   - Configurable cooldown periods

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Failed keys are automatically disabled
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - Automatic retry mechanisms

## Using as an API Service

To use this load balancer as an API service for your applications:

1. Start the application and access the UI at http://localhost:4269
2. Go to the "API Keys" section and add your Gemini API keys through the UI
3. In your client application, configure the following:
   - Base URL: `http://localhost:4269/api/v1` (or your deployed URL)
   - Authorization Header:
     - If `MASTER_API_KEY` is set in the server's `.env` file, incoming requests to `/api/v1/chat/completions` **must** include the header `Authorization: Bearer <MASTER_API_KEY>`.
     - If `MASTER_API_KEY` is **not** set (left blank) in the `.env` file, this specific authorization check is skipped. The load balancer will still use its managed Google Gemini keys for outgoing requests.
   - Model: Will be automatically populated from the available Gemini models

Example configuration in your client:

```javascript
const configuration = {
  baseURL: "http://localhost:4269/api/v1",
  // apiKey: "any-string-works", // If MASTER_API_KEY is not set on server
  // OR
  // headers: { Authorization: "Bearer your_secret_master_key_here" } // If MASTER_API_KEY is set on server
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro-exp", // Available models are shown in the dropdown
};
```
